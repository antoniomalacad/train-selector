# Train Selector

This was made during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis!

Train Selector is an app that allows you to look up the departure times of a particular station in the Greater Tokyo area. It also has a dynamic reference table to see a list of station names of a particular train line.

You can see it running here: https://antonio-malacad.shinyapps.io/train-selector/
